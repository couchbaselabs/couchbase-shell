Couchbase Shell (or cbsh) is a tool to access and work with Couchbase Server.

cbsh is a real shell, like sh or bash, but is aware of structured or tabular data, as it is built upon the open-source Nushell project.

Try typing...

ls

...to get a directory listing, and notice that the output is a table.

To navigate the tutorial you can use 'tutorial next' to proceed, 'tutorial prev' to go back, or 'tutorial page <name>' to go to a specific page.
You can try out different commands and your current step will be remembered.

Try running 'tutorial next' now to move to the next step of the tutorial.
    ");
        m.insert(
            "overview",
            "
cbsh is connected to one or more Couchbase Server databases.

Try 'nodes' to list the nodes in the active database.

Try 'cb-env managed' to list the databases currently managed by Couchbase Shell.

And, use 'tutorial next' to move to the next step in the tutorial.
    ",
        );
        m.insert(
            "navigation",
            "
Nushell offers the ability to auto complete commands that you've run previously.

Try 'ls | sort-by size' which list the items in the current directory sorted by size.

Now try typing 'ls' you will see that the previous command is shown, to perform auto-completion press the right arrow key and you'll see that 'ls | sort-by size' is now ready to run.

Use 'tutorial next' to move to the next step in the tutorial.
    ",
        );
        m.insert(
            "pipeline",
            "
Commands in cbsh can be pipelined into a chain of commands.

Try...

  nodes | where status = \"healthy\"

That pipes the tabular output of the nodes command to the where command.

Try...

  nodes | where status = \"healthy\" | to json

Use 'tutorial next' to move to the next step in the tutorial.
    ",
        );
        m.insert(
            "doc",
            "
You can create document by using commands like 'doc upsert KEY VALUE'.

Try...

    doc upsert mydoc {\"my\":\"doc\"}

You can retrieve documents by using the 'doc get KEY' command.

Try...

  doc get mydoc

The doc command also takes optional flags in order to
format or reshape the output data.

Try...

  doc get mydoc | flatten

You can use the -a flag to totally flatten the data:

  doc get mydoc | flatten -a

To learn more, try 'help doc' and 'help doc get'.

    ",
        );
        m.insert("query", "
You can use the query command to run N1QL queries (or SQL for JSON queries) against the Couchbase Server database.

Try...

    query 'SELECT name, callsign FROM `travel-sample` LIMIT 5'

And, you can pipe the tabular data to commands like save...

    query 'SELECT name, callsign FROM `travel-sample` LIMIT 5' | save output.csv

Which you can then see the contents of (note that the output has automatically been formatted to csv)...

    cat output.csv

You can try the same for other formats too, such as JSON.
Try 'to --help' to see the available formats.

        m.insert(
            "conclusion",
            "
The Couchbase Shell can do a lot more, including...

- create, retrieve, update and delete JSON docs from the database.

- import and export JSON documents into / out-from the database.

- execute N1QL (e.g., SQL for JSON) queries.

- manage clusters, buckets, stats and system setup.

- and much more...

That's it for this quick tutorial!
