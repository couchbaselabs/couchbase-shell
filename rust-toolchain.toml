# So, you want to update the Rust toolchain...
# The key is making sure all our dependencies support the version of Rust we're using,
# and that nushell compiles on all the platforms tested in our CI.

# Here's some documentation on how to use this file:
# https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html#the-toolchain-file

[toolchain]
# The default profile includes rustc, rust-std, cargo, rust-docs, rustfmt and clippy.
# https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/concepts/profiles.html
profile = "default"
channel = "1.66.1"
