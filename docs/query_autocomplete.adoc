== Query Autocomplete

Query Autocomplete is designed to help users dip their toes into the wonderful world of n1ql without having to struggle with the particulars of query structure and formatting.
Users can take advantage of Couchbase Shell's context to generate queries against their own collections and documents.

=== Usage

Query Autocomplete is implemented as a https://www.nushell.sh/book/modules.html[nushell module], which is added to the environment when the shell is started. 
Before a query can be generated you need to set an <<_cb_env_bucketscopecollection,active bucket and scope>> so that `FROM` knows which collections you can query.
Here we use the `travel-sample` bucket and `inventory` scope which can easily be loaded onto your cluster using <<_buckets_load_sample,`buckets load-sample`>>.

```
👤 Charlie 🏠 local in 🗄 travel-sample.inventory._default
>
```

Type `FROM` followed by a space then press tab to see the possible completions:

```
👤 Charlie 🏠 local in 🗄 travel-sample.inventory._default
| FROM
airline             airport             hotel               landmark
route
```

The suggestions here are all of the collections within your active scope. 
If you are familiar with query languages you may be used to beginning with SELECT.
So that `FROM` knows which fields to suggest later the collection is required first. 
Choose one of the collections using the arrow keys or tab, then the enter key.
Here we will go with the `landmark` collection:

```
👤 Charlie 🏠 local in 🗄 travel-sample.inventory._default
> FROM landmark 
```

Now a collection is chosen, put a space after then press tab again for the next suggestions:

```
👤 Charlie 🏠 local in 🗄 travel-sample.inventory._default
> FROM landmark SELECT
```

This time the only valid word is `SELECT` so this is added to the partial query without you needing to choose it.
Now we can see what we can `SELECT` from the `landmark` docs:

```
👤 Charlie 🏠 local in 🗄 travel-sample.inventory._default
| FROM landmark SELECT
*                   `activity`          `address`           `alt`
`city`              `content`           `country`           `directions`
`email`             `geo`               `hours`             `id`
`image`             `image_direct_url`  `name`              `phone`
`price`             `state`             `title`             `tollfree`
`type`              `url`
```

Choose the field, or wildcard, then continue to the next completion. 
Let's choose the `name` field and generate the next set of completions:

```
👤 Charlie 🏠 local in 🗄 travel-sample.inventory._default
| FROM landmark SELECT `name`
WHERE               LIMIT               ORDER BY            *
`activity`          `address`           `alt`               `city`
`content`           `country`           `directions`        `email`
`geo`               `hours`             `id`                `image`
`image_direct_url`  `phone`             `price`             `state`
`title`             `tollfree`          `type`              `url`
```

Let's `SELECT` the address as well:

```
👤 Charlie 🏠 local in 🗄 travel-sample.inventory._default
| FROM landmark SELECT `name` `address`
WHERE               LIMIT               ORDER BY            *
`activity`          `alt`               `city`              `content`
`country`           `directions`        `email`             `geo`
`hours`             `id`                `image`             `image_direct_url`
`phone`             `price`             `state`             `title`
`tollfree`          `type`              `url`
```

Now let's add a `WHERE` clause:

```
👤 Charlie 🏠 local in 🗄 travel-sample.inventory._default
| FROM landmark SELECT `name` `address` WHERE
ANY                 EVERY               `activity`          `address`
`alt`               `city`              `content`           `country`
`directions`        `email`             `geo`               `hours`
`id`                `image`             `image_direct_url`  `name`
`phone`             `price`             `state`             `title`
`tollfree`          `type`              `url`
```

Let's take a look at some Parisian landmarks, for that we need to conditionally SELECT on the `city` field:

```
👤 Charlie 🏠 local in 🗄 travel-sample.inventory._default
| FROM landmark SELECT `name` `address` WHERE `city`
!=                  <                   <=                  ==
>                   >=                  LIKE
```

After choosing a condition field the command suggests all of the valid operators. 

```
👤 Charlie 🏠 local in 🗄 travel-sample.inventory._default
| FROM landmark SELECT `name` `address` WHERE `city` ==
NO RECORDS FOUND
```

Sometimes the autocomplete command will not have any suggestions, for example after an operator in a WHERE clause.
This is because this value needs to be supplied by the User, since we want landmarks in Paris we need to manually type this: 

```
👤 Charlie 🏠 local in 🗄 travel-sample.inventory._default
| FROM landmark SELECT `name` `address` WHERE `city` == Paris
AND                 LIMIT               ORDER BY
```

Once we have completed the WHERE condition then the autocomplete command can suggest the next word again. 
Let's add an `ORDER BY` clause to our query: 

```
👤 Charlie 🏠 local in 🗄 travel-sample.inventory._default
| FROM landmark SELECT `name` `address` WHERE `city` == Paris ORDER BY
`name`              `address`
```

Since we can only order by fields that we have selected from the documents these are all that are suggested.
Let's order by `name`:

```
👤 Charlie 🏠 local in 🗄 travel-sample.inventory._default
| FROM landmark SELECT `name` `address` WHERE `city` == Paris ORDER BY `name`
`address`           ASC                 DESC                LIMIT
```

Finally let's add a LIMIT to the number of results from our query: 

```
👤 Charlie 🏠 local in 🗄 travel-sample.inventory._default
| FROM landmark SELECT `name` `address` WHERE `city` == Paris ORDER BY `name` LIMIT
NO RECORDS FOUND
```

As with the WHERE condition value the number of results needs to be supplied by the User so there are no suggestions.
Let's LIMIT the number of results to 10:

```
👤 Charlie 🏠 local in 🗄 travel-sample.inventory._default
| FROM landmark SELECT `name` `address` WHERE `city` == Paris ORDER BY `name` LIMIT 10
```

Once the query is complete press enter to execute it:

```
👤 Charlie 🏠 local in 🗄 travel-sample.inventory._default
> FROM landmark SELECT `name` `address` WHERE `city` == Paris ORDER BY `name` LIMIT 10

If you want to see fully formatted query then you can print this using the `--print-query` flag: 

```
👤 Charlie 🏠 local in 🗄 travel-sample.inventory._default
> FROM landmark SELECT `name` `address` WHERE `city` == Paris ORDER BY `name` LIMIT 10 --print_query
SELECT `name` , `address` FROM landmark WHERE `city` = "Paris" ORDER BY `name` LIMIT 10
```
