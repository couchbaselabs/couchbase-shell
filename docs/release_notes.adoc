=== 0.75.1 - 2023-04-13

**This release contains a number of breaking changes, which are explicitly called out below.**
As our versioning continues to track the underlying Nushell minor version this has required breaking changes in a patch version.

* Updated config file to rename `[[cluster]]` to `[[database]]` (`[[cluster]]` will continue to work).
* **Breaking** Updated config file to rename `hostnames` to `connstr` and changed the format to be a string.
* Added support, and detection, for different "cluster types"; Capella and Other. This allows us to modify behaviour based on cluster type.
* *Breaking* Renamed `clusters health` to `health`.
* *Breaking* Renamed other `clusters ...` commands to `database ...`
* Replaced references to cluster with database.
* *Breaking* Removed support for whoami
