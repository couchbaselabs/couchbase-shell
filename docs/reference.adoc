=== Config File Format

The `~/.cbsh/config` file with examples:

[source,toml]
----
# Allows us to evolve in the future without breaking old config files
version = 1

[[database]]
identifier = "default"
connstr = "127.0.0.1"
default-bucket = "travel-sample"
default-scope = "my-scope"
default-collection = "my-collection"
# The following can be part of the config or credentials
username = "Administrator"
password = "password"
# TLS defaults to on, accepting all certs
# tls-enabled = true
# tls-cert-path = "/path/to/cert" # either accept all certs or provide a cert path
# tls-accept-all-certs = true
# tls-validate-hostnames = false

# Timeouts broadly apply to the operations that you would expect them to.
# That is:
# * data: commands using the kv service such as `doc`
# * query: `query` commands
# * analytics: `analytics` commands
# * search: `search` commands
# * management: commands that perform management level operations, such as `users`, `bucket`, `health` etc...
data-timeout = "10s"
query-timeout = "75s"
analytics-timeout = "75s"
search-timeout = "1m 15s"
management-timeout = "75s"
# capella-organisation= "org"

# [[capella-organisation]]
# identifier = "org"
# access-key = "x8rLuZ3YBNEqPfb8whKHxt0v9wxf1pdG"
# secret-key = "T26Rh3zRaUYFIzdRQfbdPxSQN7bxJatE2jgg1JDQqZ1yyqwGUZt7nx2E6w1yzosY"

[source,toml]
