== Couchbase Capella (DBaaS)

https://cloud.couchbase.com/sign-up?ref=cbsh-web-capella[Couchabse Capella] is a Database as a Service offering from Couchbase which you can interact with from Couchbase Shell.

=== Document Level Commands

Document level commands like those under `doc`, `analytics`, `query`, and `search` (with a couple of exceptions) do not require any special changes to the `config` config file.

You need to:

    - https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/clusters/create-cluster.html[create a cluster] in your Couchbase Capella account
    - ensure that your https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/security/allow-ip-address.html[IP address is whitelisted]
    - ensure that you have a https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/security/manage-database-users.html[database user]
    - Populate the relevant cluster section in the `config` file with the public address and database user credentials.

=== Management Commands

Non-cloud specific (i.e. commands not prefixed with `clouds`) commands (broadly referred to as "management operations") require a specific section to be added to the `config` file as well as an extra entry in the relevant cluster section.
Before being able to perform management operations against Couchbase Capella you must https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/public-api-guide/using-cloud-public-api.html#access-and-secret-keys[generate access and secret keys] to enable Couchbase Shell to interact with your cloud.

=== Cloud Commands

Some of the commands that have the `clouds` prefix require an extra section to be added to the `config` file.
The commands that this apply to are any that perform an operation directly against a specific cloud instance.

=== Config file format

The `cloud-organisation` and `cloud` sections in the `config` file are used as follows:

[source,toml]
----
# Allows us to evolve in the future without breaking old config files
version = 1

[[cluster]]
identifier = "default"
hostnames = ["127.0.0.1"]
default-bucket = "travel-sample"
# The following can be part of the config or credentials
username = "Administrator"
password = "password"

[[cluster]]
# identifier *must* match the name of the cluster as provided in Couchbase Cloud
identifier = "cloud"
hostnames = ["xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx.dp.cloud.couchbase.com"]
default-bucket = "couchbasecloudbucket"
username = "dave"
password = "Pa55word!"
data-timeout = "25s"
query-timeout = "1m 15s"
tls-enabled = true
tls-validate-hostnames = false
tls-accept-all-certs = true
cloud-organisation = "org"

[[cloud]]
identifier = "a-cloud"
default-project = "cloud-project"

[[cloud]]
identifier = "other-cloud"
default-project = "cloud-project"

[[cloud-organisation]]
identifier = "org"
access-key = "x8rLuZ3YBNEqPfb8whKHxt0v9wxf1pdG"
secret-key = "T26Rh3zRaUYFIzdRQfbdPxSQN7bxJatE2jgg1JDQqZ1yyqwGUZt7nx2E6w1yzosY"

----

Note that the identifier of the cluster, and the cloud *must* match the name of the cluster in Couchbase Capella for management operations to work.
Also note that some operations are not supported by Couchbase Capella.
