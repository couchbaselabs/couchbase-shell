=== `allow ip`

Adds the given IP address to the active Capella cluster's allow list.
Note that this command will not work against locally hosted Couchbase Server clusters.

The IP address can be supplied as a positional parameter:

```
👤 Charlie 🏠 remote in 🗄 travel-sample._default._default
> allow ip 143.159.160.194
[INFO] 2025-01-07 09:24:48.168 IP address supplied without a subnet mask, defaulting to '/32'
```

Allowed IP addresses require a subnet mask, and if one is not specified CBShell will default to `/32`.

Alternatively the IP address can be piped into the command.
For example we can use one command to get our IP address and pipe the result into `allow ip`:

```
👤 Administrator 🏠 remote in 🗄 travel-sample._default._default
> curl ifconfig.me | allow ip

[INFO] 2025-01-07 09:23:49.079 IP address supplied without a subnet mask, defaulting to '/32'
```
