# Couchbase Shell - Shell Yeah!
![CI](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/couchbase-shell/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

Couchbase Shell (`cbsh`) is a modern, productive and fun shell for Couchbase Server and Cloud.

*Note that while the project is maintained by Couchbase, it is not covered under the EE support contract. We are providing community support through this bug tracker.*

The documentation is available [here](https://couchbase.sh/docs/).

## Quickstart

First, download the archive for your operating system.

- Linux: [cbsh-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/couchbase-shell/releases/download/v0.75.1/cbsh-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz)
- macOS: [cbsh-x86_64-apple-darwin.zip](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/couchbase-shell/releases/download/v0.75.1/cbsh-x86_64-apple-darwin.zip)
- Linux aarch64 [cbsh-aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/couchbase-shell/releases/download/v0.75.1/cbsh-aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz)
- macOS aarch64: [cbsh-aarch64-apple-darwin.zip](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/couchbase-shell/releases/download/v0.75.1/cbsh-aarch64-apple-darwin.zip)
- Windows: [cbsh-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/couchbase-shell/releases/download/v0.75.1/cbsh-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip)

You do not need any extra dependencies to run `cbsh`, it comes "batteries included".

**macOS Users**: You will need to grant the binary permissions through `Security & Privacy` settings the first time you run it. 

After extracting the archive, run the `cbsh` binary in your terminal.

```
❯ ./cbsh --version
The Couchbase Shell 0.75.1
```

## Basic Usage

Once the binary is available, you can connect to a cluster on the fly and run a simple command to list the (user-visible) buckets.

```
❯ ./cbsh --hostnames 127.0.0.1 -u username -p                       
Password: 
👤 username 🏠 default in 🗄 <not set>
> buckets
───┬─────────┬───────────────┬───────────┬──────────┬──────────────────────┬───────────┬───────────────┬────────┬───────
 # │ cluster │     name      │   type    │ replicas │ min_durability_level │ ram_quota │ flush_enabled │ status │ cloud 
───┼─────────┼───────────────┼───────────┼──────────┼──────────────────────┼───────────┼───────────────┼────────┼───────
 0 │ default │ beer-sample   │ couchbase │        1 │ none                 │  209.7 MB │ false         │        │ false 
 1 │ default │ default       │ couchbase │        1 │ none                 │  104.9 MB │ true          │        │ false 
 2 │ default │ targetBucket  │ couchbase │        0 │ none                 │  104.9 MB │ true          │        │ false 
 3 │ default │ travel-sample │ couchbase │        1 │ none                 │  209.7 MB │ false         │        │ false 
───┴─────────┴───────────────┴───────────┴──────────┴──────────────────────┴───────────┴───────────────┴────────┴───────
```

While passing in command-line arguments is fine if you want to connect quickly, using the dotfile `~/.cbsh/config` for configuration is much more convenient. Here is a simple config which connects to a cluster running on localhost:

```toml
version = 1

[[cluster]]
identifier = "my-local-cb-node"
hostnames = ["127.0.0.1"]
default-bucket = "travel-sample"
username = "Administrator"
password = "password"
```

After the config is in place, you can run `./cbsh` without any arguments and it will connect to that cluster after start automatically. 

The downloaded archive contains an `example` directory which also contains sample configuration files for more information. Also, please see the [docs](https://couchbase.sh/docs/) for full guidance, including information about how to work with multiple clusters at the same time.

## Building From Source

If you want to build from source, make sure you have a modern rust version and cargo installed (ideally through the [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) toolchain).

After that, you can build and/or run through `cargo build` / `cargo run`. By default it will build in debug mode, so if you want to build a binary and test the performance, make sure to include `--release`.

### Installing as a binary through cargo

If you just want to use it and don't want to bother compiling all the time, you can use `cargo install --path .` to install it into your cargo bin path (run from the checked out source directory).

```
❯ cargo install --path .
  Installing couchbase-shell v0.75.1 (/Users/michaelnitschinger/couchbase/code/rust/couchbase-shell)
    Updating crates.io index
  Downloaded plist v1.2.1
  Downloaded onig v6.3.0
  Downloaded string_cache v0.8.2
  Downloaded num-bigint v0.4.2
  ...

```

Grab a quick coffee or tea since this will take some time to compile.
