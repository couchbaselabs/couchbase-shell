(a) for acquisition by or on behalf of civil agencies, as necessary to obtain protection as “commercial computer software” and related documentation in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and as specified in Subpart 12.1212 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), 48 C.F.R.12.1212, and its successors; and
(b) for acquisition by or on behalf of the Department of Defense (DOD) and any agencies or units thereof, as necessary to obtain protection as “commercial computer software” and related documentation in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and as specified in Subparts 227.7202-1 and 227.7202-3 of the DOD FAR Supplement, 48 C.F.R.227.7202-1 and 227.7202-3, and its successors, manufacturer is Couchbase, Inc.

6. Support.
6.1 This entire Section 6 applies only to Enterprise Licenses fully paid for by Customer and not to Free Licenses.
6.2 Couchbase will provide Customer with the level of Support indicated on the applicable Order and paid for by Customer. For all Licensed Nodes and Licensed Devices within a specific Production Deployment, all such nodes and instances must be at the same level of Support, including any that are used for disaster recovery or backup that are associated with the specific Production Deployment. For the avoidance of doubt, each specific Production Deployment can have its own level of Support. Similarly, all Licensed Nodes and Licensed Devices in a development or test environment must be at the same level of Support but such Licensed Nodes and Licensed Devices may be at a different support level than the Production Deployment(s).
6.3 When using the Cross-Data Center Replication feature, Customer must have all Licensed Nodes and Licensed Devices at the same level of Support for all instances on all sides of the replication connection, including if one side of the connection is only used for disaster recovery or backup.
6.4 Couchbase may modify the terms of Support from time to time, provided that such modifications do not materially and adversely affect Customer’s Support subscription.

7. Fees.
7.1 This Section 7 applies only to Enterprise Licenses fully paid for by Customer and not to Free Licenses.
7.2 Customer will pay Couchbase the Fees in advance, within thirty (30) days of the date of the invoice, unless explicitly otherwise indicated in the applicable Order or SOW.  All payments are non-cancelable, not subject to the Limitation of Liability in Section 12 below, and shall be made in the currency stated on the applicable Order. Fees are non-refundable except to the extent expressly provided for in this Agreement. Late payments will bear interest at the lesser of one- and one-half percent (1 ½%) per month or the maximum rate allowed by applicable law.  Customer will reimburse Couchbase for all reasonable costs and expenses incurred (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) in collecting any overdue amounts.
7.3 All Fees payable by Customer are exclusive of applicable taxes and duties (such as, without limitation, VAT, Service Tax, GST, excise taxes, sales and transactions taxes, and gross receipts tax (collectively, the “Transaction Taxes”). If applicable, Couchbase may charge and Customer shall pay all Transaction Taxes that Couchbase is legally obligated or authorized to collect from Customer. Customer will provide such information to Couchbase as reasonably required to determine whether Couchbase is obligated to collect Transaction Taxes from Customer. Couchbase will not collect, and Customer will not pay, any Transaction Taxes for which Customer furnishes a properly completed exemption certificate or a direct payment permit certificate for which Couchbase may claim an available exemption from such Transaction Taxes. All payments made by Customer to Couchbase under this Agreement will be made free and clear of any deduction or withholding, as may be required by law. If any such deduction or withholding (including but not limited to cross-border withholding taxes) is required on any payment, Customer will pay such additional amounts as are necessary so that the net amount received by Couchbase is equal to the amount then due and payable under this Agreement. Couchbase will provide Customer with such tax forms as are reasonably requested in order to reduce or eliminate the amount of any withholding or deduction for taxes in respect of payments made under this Agreement.
7.4 Customer is obligated to pay all applicable Fees without any requirement for Couchbase to provide a purchase order (“PO”) number on Couchbase’s invoice (or otherwise). If Customer sends Couchbase a PO in lieu of executing an Order, the PO will be deemed a binding contract offer which Couchbase may accept by (i) signing the PO or (ii) sending a written order acknowledgment of acceptance of the PO (thereby forming a mutually agreed Order governed by this Agreement). In any event, only the Commercial Details listed on PO shall be considered part of the Order created (exclusive of any pre-printed terms on the PO). Any other terms on the PO which either (i) conflict with the terms of this Agreement, or (ii) are not agreed under this Agreement, will be void and without effect, even if Couchbase signs the PO.  All accepted POs will automatically be governed by this Agreement (even if the PO does not reference this Agreement). It is expressly agreed that Section 7 shall apply in respect of any PO sent by Customer and accepted by Couchbase.

8. Records Retention and Audit.
8.1 During any Subscription Term and for at least one (1) year thereafter, Customer shall maintain complete and accurate records to permit Couchbase to verify Customer’s compliance with this Agreement (including the number of Licensed Nodes and Licensed Devices used by Customer in Productive Use as well as Customer’s compliance with its obligations post-termination or expiration), and provide Couchbase with such records within ten (10) days of request.
8.2 Every three (3) months within a Subscription Term (or on another cadence as mutually agreed between the parties) or upon request by Couchbase for any Productive Use where no Order is in place, Customer shall self-certify to Couchbase the total number of Licensed Nodes and Licensed Devices currently deployed and used by Customer in each cluster running in a production, test, or development environment. Such self-certification shall be in accordance with Couchbase’s instruction and in the form of either a (i) written report signed by an authorized representative of Customer or (ii) copy of an automatically generated report created by Customer. Couchbase will review such reports and determine if any true up to the applicable Order or Productive Use without an Order is required. Additional fees for any excess usage shall be calculated based on the fees specified in the applicable Order for the applicable Licensed Node or Licensed Device size and type, and prorated, as applicable. If (i) the excess usage includes nodes or device sizes or types for which fees are not specified in the applicable existing Order or (ii) Productive Use occurred without an Order, then the (additional) fees shall be calculated based on Couchbase's list price in effect at the time and prorated, as applicable.
8.3 Upon at least thirty (30) days prior written notice, but no more than once in any (12) twelve month period, Couchbase may audit Customer’s use of the Software solely as necessary to verify Customer’s compliance with the terms of this Agreement during the Subscription Term and for one (1) year thereafter. Any such audit will be conducted during regular business hours at Customer’s facilities and will not unreasonably interfere with Customer’s business activities. Customer will provide Couchbase with access to the relevant Customer records and facilities.

9. Confidentiality.
9.1 Customer and Couchbase will maintain the confidentiality of Confidential Information. “Confidential Information” means any proprietary information received by the other party during, or prior to entering into, this Agreement that a party should know is confidential or proprietary based on the circumstances surrounding the disclosure, including the Software and any non-public technical and business information (including Commercial Details).  Confidential Information does not include information that (a) is or becomes generally known to the public through no fault of or breach of this Agreement by the receiving party; (b) is rightfully known by the receiving party at the time of disclosure without an obligation of confidentiality to the disclosing party; (c) is independently developed by the receiving party without use of the disclosing party’s Confidential Information; or (d) the receiving party rightfully obtains from a third party without restriction on use or disclosure.
9.2 The receiving party of any Confidential Information of the other party agrees not to use such Confidential Information for any purpose except as necessary to fulfill its obligations and exercise its rights under this Agreement. The receiving party shall protect the secrecy of and prevent any unauthorized disclosure or use of the disclosing party’s Confidential Information using the same degree of care that it takes to protect its own confidential information and in no event shall use less than reasonable care.
9.3 Upon termination of this Agreement, the receiving party will, at the disclosing party’s option, promptly return or destroy (and provide written certification of such destruction) the disclosing party’s Confidential Information. A party may disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to the extent required by law or regulation.

-----------------------------------------
IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION:  From time to time, Couchbase may release versions of the Software and/or certain features that are not generally available (the “Non-GA Offering”), including test, alpha, beta, trial, pre-production, preview and/or developer preview versions or features. If Customer uses any Non-GA Offering,  then the same terms and conditions of the “Free Licenses” under the Agreement above shall apply, subject to the modifications below.
Non-GA Offering Supplemental Terms
For any Non-GA Offering, the definition of Software in Section 1 of the Agreement shall be replaced by the following and all references to “Software” in the applicable provisions shall refer to the below instead:
“Software” means the object code version of the applicable Couchbase product, including any Non-GA Offering, either (i) as reflected in an Order or (ii) as otherwise made available to Customer under this Agreement.
Section 2.1 of the Agreement shall be replaced in its entirety by the following:
Section 2.1. License Grant. Subject to Customer’s compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Documentation, Couchbase hereby grants to Customer a revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, royalty-free, non-fee bearing limited license to install and use the Non-GA Offering of the Software only for Customer’s own internal non-production use for the purpose of evaluation and/or development, if applicable (the “Non-GA Offering License”). By accepting an invitation to install or use, or by installing or using the Non-GA Offering, Customer acknowledges and agrees that (i) it has relied upon its own skill and judgment in electing to use such Non-GA Offering in its sole discretion, (ii) the Non-GA Offering may not work correctly or in the same way the final version may work and is offered exclusive of any warranty (as described in Section 10 of the Agreement) or service level agreement, (iii) the license granted to Customer with respect to the Non-GA Offering is revocable and terminable at any time in Couchbase’s sole and absolute discretion, (iv) Couchbase may change, withdraw or discontinue the Non-GA Offering at any time without notice and is under no obligation to make such generally available, and (v) Couchbase is not obligated to provide any services or support, including Support, Professional Services, updates, patches, enhancements, or fixes (either in the form of descriptions in the Documentation or on the Couchbase website or otherwise). Couchbase may use any data, feedback or information that Customer makes available to Couchbase or that Couchbase derives or generates from Customer’s use of the Non-GA Offering (“Feedback”), and Customer hereby irrevocably assigns to Couchbase all right, title, and interest in such Feedback. Customer agrees to the restrictions generally applicable to the Free Licenses and Software, as applicable, under this Agreement and any additional requirements set forth by Couchbase in writing (whether in the Documentation or otherwise) regarding any particular Non-GA Offering. For the avoidance of doubt, Customer shall not make any Productive Use of any Non-GA Offering under any circumstance.
Section 12 of the Agreement shall be replaced by the following:
12. Limitation of Liability. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THE COUCHBASE PARTIES BE LIABLE TO CUSTOMER OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY FOR: (A) ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES; OR (B) THE COST OF PROCURING SUBSTITUTE PRODUCTS OR PROFESSIONAL SERVICES ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE, DOCUMENTATION OR THE PROFESSIONAL SERVICES; OR (C) DAMAGES OR OTHER LOSSES FOR LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF BUSINESS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA, COMPUTER FAILURE OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY THEREOF AND REGARDLESS OF THE LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY (CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) UPON WHICH THE CLAIM IS BASED. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THE COUCHBASE PARTIES’ AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO CUSTOMER, FROM ALL CAUSES OF ACTION AND UNDER ALL THEORIES OF LIABILITY EXCEED ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS (US $100). The parties expressly acknowledge and agree that Couchbase  has set its prices and entered into this Agreement in reliance upon the limitations of liability specified herein, which allocate the risk between Couchbase  and Customer and form a basis of the bargain between the parties.
Section 13.1 of the Agreement shall be replaced by the following:
13.1 This Agreement is effective as of the date of Customer’s acceptance of this Agreement and will continue until: (i) Customer ceases to use the Non-GA Offering and/or the Non-GA Offering License, (ii) the Non-GA Offering becomes generally available (in which case the terms of the Free License or the Enterprise License (with or without an Order), as applicable, shall automatically apply to Customer’s use of the Software), (iii) Couchbase discontinues and terminates the Non-GA Offering and/or Non-GA Offering Licenses, in its sole discretion, or (iv) either party terminates this Agreement as set forth in this Section, provided that the parties’ rights and obligations of the provisions listed in Section 13.4 shall survive any termination.
